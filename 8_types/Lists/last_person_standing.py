''' Demonstration of lists used to make a table. The
table represents the class seating assignments. 

Notice there are two variables row and column. They 
are used for 2 different objectives. First, figuring out
how many students in class and the winner use row and
column for the table of columns for the row and the
actual value of the column. In the actual game play
row and column are used as indexes. '''
