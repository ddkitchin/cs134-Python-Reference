Digital Dreams

In pixels bright and circuits deep,
Where heroes wake from restless sleep,
A world awaits beyond the screen,
Where mortals dance with the machine.

The controller rests within my palm,
A gateway to a digital calm,
Where dragons soar and legends rise,
And death's just respawn in disguise.

Through kingdoms vast and dungeons dark,
I leave my temporary mark,
Each quest completed, boss defeated,
Makes the journey feel completed.

The game clock ticks through endless night,
As I battle on with all my might,
For in this realm of code and dream,
Nothing's quite the way it seems.

When morning comes and screens fade black,
I know that I'll be coming back,
To digital worlds where I can be
The hero that I long to be.

So here's to games that let us play,
And take our worries all away,
In virtual lands where we can roam,
And find a different kind of home.
